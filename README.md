# Trinomial-model-for-pricing-options

This project is to price European options using trinomail model. We will implement the Memoization to speed up the code.

Memoization is an optimization technique used in programming to improve the performance of algorithms, especially recursive ones. It works by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing the stored results when the same inputs occur again, instead of recomputing them.
