# Trinomial-model-for-pricing-options

This project is to price European options using trinomail model. We will implement the Memoization to speed up the code.

Memoization is an optimization technique used in programming to improve the performance of algorithms, especially recursive ones. It works by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing the stored results when the same inputs occur again, instead of recomputing them.

How Does Memoization Work?

· A data structure, such as a table or a dictionary, is used to store results for unique inputs.

· Before computing the result for a function, the algorithm checks if the result is already stored. If so, it directly retrieves the value.

· If the result is not stored, the algorithm computes it, stores it for future reference, and returns the result.
